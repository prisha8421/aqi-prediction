AQI Prediction using Machine Learning Models
This repository contains a comprehensive project aimed at predicting the Air Quality Index (AQI) using various machine learning models. 
The project showcases data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization of results. The following models are implemented:

Random Forest Regressor
XGBoost Regressor
Support Vector Regressor (SVR)

The goal is to predict the AQI based on environmental and air pollutant data.
Dataset
The project uses air quality data (reduced_data.csv) containing the following features:

PM2.5, NO2, PM10, NO, NOx, O3: Air pollutant concentrations
tavg: Average temperature
AQI: Target variable, representing the Air Quality Index
The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values, standardize features, and split into training and testing sets.

The results and methodology presented here can serve as a strong foundation for further exploration into environmental data science and predictive modeling.
This repository not only provides insights into the models' capabilities but also showcases the ability to tackle complex problems, making it an excellent addition to a professional portfolio.
